        		Helvetica was designed in 1957 by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann in Münchenstien, Switzerland. It’s classified as a Sans Serif Grotesque Typeface. Originally called “Die Neue Hass Grotesk”, the name was changed to Helvetica to make it more appealing on the market. Before arriving at the final name however, they wanted to call it Helvetia meaning Switzerland in Latin. Instead they went with Helvetica, meaning Swiss in Latin, to avoid having the typeface named after the country. Helvetica was designed as a neutral typeface. The idea was that the typeface was to give no impression on the meaning of the words being displayed. It also was intended to be used for a wide range of signage.<br><br>

The use of Helvetica can be seen almost anywhere. One example would be the NYC Metropolitan Transportation Authority (NYC-MTA). In 1989, they converted all their signs to a single typeface to make them more uniform and easier to read. Since then, Helvetica has been used in a wide variety of companies. Some would include Apple, Adobe, American Airlines, and Target.
